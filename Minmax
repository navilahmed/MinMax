/*Design an implement a class MinMax that has the following properties:
 * two integers min and max, where min is always smaller than max. 
 * a default constructor that sets both to 0
 * a constructor that accepts one integer and sets both to that int
 * a constructor that accepts two integers and sets min to the smallest
 * and max the largest of the two.
 * getters and setters. Note that if you try to set min to larger than max
 * then the values should switch. eg. Max = 5, min = 2 if you try
 * to set min to 8, then min should be 5 and max is 8. Same for setMax
 * eg. Max = 5, min = 2 if you try to set max to -2, then max is set to 2 
 * and min to -2. 
 * add method that accepts a MinMax object and adds min of the object to the 
 * min of the invoking object(this) and same for max. 
 * method toString() that return a string with min and max values 
 * as "min: 2, max: 5"
 * Write a tester where you test all methods and constructors of your class. 
 *
